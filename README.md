A simple **Python app** to display native macOS notifications at customizable time intervals.  
Perfect for working in focus blocks (Pomodoro-style) or reminding yourself to take breaks, drink water, or stretch 💡.  

This version uses `osascript` (built into macOS), so **no external dependencies are required** 🚀.
